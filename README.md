My favourite programs/scripts now:

- 😶‍🌫️[DeepMosaicsPlus](https://github.com/foooooooooooooooooooooooooootw/DeepMosaicsPlus), a tool originally by HypoX64 to remove mosaic censorship, which I made compatible with directml so acceleration can be done with any GPU. Optimization is currently underway.

- 💠[Pale Heart Drop Rates Dataset](https://github.com/foooooooooooooooooooooooooootw/Pale-Heart-Drop-Rates-Dataset), a dataset I started because I suspected that drop rates were skewed. I was [proven right later](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/dev_insights_perk_rng_issue).
